        <h4>A simple interface to visualize every project.</h4>
        <p>
            This page shows every project I did it from the course <a class="course" href="Projects/Day 1/index.html" >50 projects in 50 day</a> (I think I already mentioned this many times),
            in a easy way to search a specific project, just in case that I forgot how I did it, i'm searching a feature to implement
            or just to show the projects. <a href="https://github.com/ArssG/50_projects_in_50days/tree/main/Projects/Day%201" class="course">Code....</a>
